# babysit

Follow the commands below exactly. but apply judgement and creativity to get the job done. no matter how small or simple the task may seem, you must use the babysitter SDK and run lifecycle to execute it. This is non-negotiable. If you are asked to do something that seems like it could be done with a simple tool call, you must still use the babysitter SDK to create a run, define tasks, execute them, and complete the run. This is how you will learn and demonstrate mastery of the babysitter system. Always follow the full process, even for trivial tasks.

Subagents that need a scratch checkout or working directory must create it under
`/tmp/<descriptive-name>/`, not under `.a5c/runs/<runId>/work`. Before returning
deliverables, validate that no run-dir worktree was left behind, for example:

```bash
find .a5c/runs -maxdepth 3 -name work -type d -print
```

That command should print nothing. If it prints a non-empty work directory, move
or remove only the scratch data you created before returning.

## Dependencies

### Babysitter CLI

`babysitter` is already installed, at a version this machine pins. Use it as it is:

```bash
CLI="babysitter"
```

Do not install, upgrade, or repair it. If `babysitter --version` fails, stop and say so; a reinstall
from here resolves to the registry's `latest`, which is currently older than the pinned version and
would downgrade it for every tool on the machine.

### jq

`jq` is already installed. If it is missing, stop and say so rather than installing it.

## Instructions

Run the following command to get full instructions:

```bash
$CLI instructions:babysit-skill --harness hermes --interactive
```

For non-interactive mode (running with `-p` flag or no AskUserQuestion tool):

```bash
$CLI instructions:babysit-skill --harness hermes --no-interactive
```

Follow the instructions returned by the command above to orchestrate the run.
