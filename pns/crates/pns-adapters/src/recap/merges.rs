/// The pull requests merged into the named repositories inside the window, or

///
/// READ THROUGH `super::github_cli`, which owns the tool, its auth story and
/// the deadline: the whole feature is read-only by construction, which is what
/// bounds a pull request body being somebody else's text.
///
/// BOUNDED THREE WAYS, because every one of them is a way for a remote answer
/// to become this machine's problem: the window is stated in the search so the
/// service does the selecting, `--limit` caps how many come back, and the read
/// is capped in time and in bytes by the seam. A truncated listing is not JSON,
/// so the cap fails CLOSED into "unavailable" rather than into a half-read
/// section.
///
/// ANY REPOSITORY FAILING FAILS THE SECTION, deliberately. A partial list under
/// a count is a count that lies, and this section's remainder line is counted
/// against what was read.
///
/// THE WINDOW IS THE RECAP'S OWN, SHIFTED ONE SECOND. GitHub's range syntax is
/// inclusive at both ends and `activity_in`'s window is `(since, until]`, so a
/// pull request merged in the marker's own second would be fetched while every
/// event in that second is excluded. Starting the search a second later is the
/// same bracket the rest of the recap uses. ACCEPTED LIMIT: the search's
/// granularity is one second, so this is exact rather than approximate only
/// because both bounds are whole seconds to begin with.
///
/// ACCEPTED LIMIT: THE SEARCH INDEX TRAILS THE MERGE, by seconds to minutes. A
/// pull request merged shortly before the return moment can be absent from this
/// listing with no signal, and the next window opens after it, so it is never
/// reported at all. Stating the window server-side is still right (the
/// alternative is fetching everything and selecting here), and the tail pointer
/// to the repository is what closes it.
///
/// ACCEPTED LIMIT: the receipt is the pull request NUMBER, so two repositories
/// merging the same number inside one window produce two lines that cite it.
/// Both are real merges the operator can follow; the alternative is a receipt
/// carrying a repository name, which costs every line its width for a case one
/// configured repository never reaches.
