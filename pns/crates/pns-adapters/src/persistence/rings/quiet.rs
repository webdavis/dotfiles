/// closed costs every notification, including the card for a tool call the
/// operator is blocked on, with no expiry and no way for them to see it. The
/// complaint repeats for as long as the file stays broken, which is
/// proportional: it IS broken until someone fixes it.
///
/// ONLY AN ABSENT FILE IS SILENT, and it is the ordinary state. A single
/// `.ok()?` used to cover both, so a file that could not be read at all was
/// as quiet as one that was never there: unreadable permissions, a directory
/// standing in its place and bytes that are not UTF-8 each muted nothing and
/// announced nothing, which is the state nobody can discover.
