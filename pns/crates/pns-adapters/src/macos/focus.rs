/// path would let any producer force the answer in either direction, which is
/// the objection `Overrides::muted` already states about the mute. The test
/// seam is the sandbox's own `HOME`, which every binary test already sets.
///
/// NOTHING NAMED MEANS NOTHING READ. With no `[focus] silence` list there is
/// no mode an assertion could match, so the two files are never opened and the
/// default machine pays no IO for a feature it did not ask for.
///
/// `Err` IS "the store could not be read", and it exists for the doctor alone:
/// the event path reads it as not silenced, because this is a private,
/// undocumented Apple store that can change schema on any macOS update and a
/// reader that failed closed would silence every banner, card and pulse on the
/// morning after an upgrade. The doctor is the one place that says so out
/// loud, and the ERROR ITSELF is carried out rather than flattened, because a
/// store that is absent and a store that is gated send the operator to two
/// different places.
///
/// THE CATALOG'S OWN FAILURE IS NOT ONE OF THOSE. An unreadable
/// `ModeConfigurations.json` resolves no names, so only a raw `modeIdentifier`
/// in the config can still match: silencing less rather than more, which is
/// the same direction. It is reported rather than errored for exactly that
/// reason, and the doctor says it in a clause of its own.
///
/// READ THROUGH `readable_state_file` for the reasons that function states about
/// this tool's own files, which hold for a foreign one just as well: a FIFO at
/// the path would park the event forever, and a file some other hand grew is
/// otherwise learned about by allocating it. The live store is 6 KiB against
/// the existing 256 KiB ceiling.
