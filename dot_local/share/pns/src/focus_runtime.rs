/// THE UNREADABLE STATE IS WHAT EARNS THE LINE. If the store is ever gated
/// behind Full Disk Access, moves, or changes schema, this feature dies OPEN
/// and SILENT: pns simply stops respecting Focus, and nothing else anywhere
/// would ever say so.
///
/// THE ACCEPTED LIMIT, stated rather than designed around: the parser is
/// TOTAL, so bytes that are not JSON at all, and a schema change that leaves
/// the file valid JSON, both read as "no Focus" rather than as an error. Only
/// a failed READ of the file itself reaches the last two sentences, and a
/// store that had stopped being readable in any useful sense would still be
/// reported as quiet. Telling those apart needs a positive assertion about a
/// shape Apple promises nothing about.
///
/// FIVE SENTENCES, because ABSENT AND UNREADABLE ARE DIFFERENT THINGS TO SAY,
/// which is the rule `decision_section` and `missed_line` already follow one
/// screen up. A machine that has never asserted a Focus has no store, and
/// telling that operator their database could not be read sends them after a
/// Full Disk Access grant that was never the problem.
