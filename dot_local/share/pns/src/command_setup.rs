/// is `pns::setup`; this asks, reads a line, and publishes. It EXITS NON-ZERO
/// on every refusal, which the always-exit-0 contract permits for the same
/// reason `quiet` does: that contract covers the hook and notification paths,
/// where a non-zero exit fails the turn being reported on, and this is hand
/// typed and is never a hook.
///
/// IT REFUSES A WALK NOBODY CAN ANSWER. Without a terminal there is no walk,
/// and guessing every answer would write a config the operator never agreed
/// to, over one they may already have.
