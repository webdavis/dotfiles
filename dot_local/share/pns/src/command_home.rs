/// The `home` mode: one reading of the home probe, reported in one line, and
/// the one stale-identifier alert that reading may earn.
///
/// A DIAGNOSTIC FIRST: it always exits 0 and says what it found, including
/// every way it can be unconfigured, because its job is to answer "why did the
/// probe not read" as much as "is the device home". The key itself is never
/// printed, on any path.
///
/// AND THE TRIGGER for the stale-identifier alert, on exactly the condition
/// that prints the warning. This is the only code that reads the sensor and it
/// already holds the derive/decide/remember trio, so one call site keeps ONE
/// memory and ONE decision; a second entrypoint would be a second place for
/// the episode decision to fall out of step. The consequence is deliberate: a
/// hand-run `pns home` no longer consumes an episode silently, it delivers it.
