/// What moshi-hook says about this host's pairing, in TWO BOUNDED SPAWNS of
/// one subcommand.
///
/// The split is a correctness argument rather than a style one. `status
/// --json` is local-only, measured at 77ms with the base URL pointed at an
/// unroutable host, and it carries the pairing fact pns grades. Plain `status`
/// is the only shape carrying a server verdict and is the only thing the
/// doctor puts on the network for its own sake. One plain-only call would put
/// the local fact behind the network, so an outage would read as "pairing
/// could not be checked" on a machine that could have answered.
///
/// `probe` IS NEVER CALLED. Measured on 0.3.3, it answers `running: true` and
/// `gateway: true` against a HOME holding no pairing at all while its hostId
/// disappears, so its daemon-side provenance cannot be stated honestly.
///
/// A FORWARD RISK, named rather than coded around: every pairing state exits 0
/// today, so a future moshi that exited non-zero when unpaired would come back
/// as no answer and be reported as "could not check" while the approval path
/// is really dead. A future moshi that renamed or dropped the `server:` line
/// degrades the other way, silently and safely.
///
/// THE WORST CASE IS THE TWO DEADLINES ADDED, not the larger of them: the legs
/// run one after the other, so a moshi-hook wedged on both puts 5s + 8s on a
/// hand-typed command, measured at 13.07 seconds. Ten seconds is not the
/// bound and nobody should treat it as one.
